The POD Component is like an object, but can be anything. Each component will have a Next button, and it will be grayed out until it the objective is completed.

Types of POD Components (so far):

Narrative - This will give the user information. It could be video, text, an image, or combination of all. 

Question - This will give the user a question from one of the exams. It will not be counted as answered for the actual exam. It is going to be set up so that usually you will put a Narrative, then a Question. 

Exam - This is an exam like you have seen, except it will be the full exam, and will be needed to pass in order to get to the next component.

Scenario - This component will comprise of a topology and will present a problem to begin with. The user must fix the problem in order to continue.

Custom Activity - This is a customized code that makes the user interact in some way. For instance, it might be an activity to translate a binary number into decimal, but it is custom, and usually one shot action.

Document - Read a document. Self explanatory. This could be followed up with a question, or custom activity to reinforce the knowledge.

File - Download a file. Self explanatory. Follow up with question or custom activity.

The thing is with this new setup, it will be linear. So the first thing the user sees is POD Component 1.
They will not see POD Component 2 until they have completed #1.

At the top, there will be a progress bar.

The first POD using this system will be How to use a POD, a tutorial.
