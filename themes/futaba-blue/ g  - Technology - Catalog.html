However, you asked us to do more. You asked us to bring you even closer to the metal and to do so on an unparalleled assortment of hardware. You also asked us for better tools so that you can squeeze every last drop of performance out of your PC, tablet, phone and console. http:\/\/schedule.gdconf.com\/session-id\/828184 Approaching Zero Driver Overhead in OpenGL - Driver overhead has been a frustrating reality for game developers for the entire life of the PC game industry.

In this unprecedented sponsored session, Graham Sellers (AMD), Tim Foley (Intel), Cass Everitt (NVIDIA) and John McDonald (NVIDIA) will present high-level concepts available in today&#039;s OpenGL implementations that radically reduce driver overhead--by up to 10x or more. http:\/\/schedule.gdconf.com\/session-id\/828316 IT&#039;S OVER, AMD IS FINISHED"},"40534286":{"date":1393424091,"r":35,"i":14,"lr":{"id":40534700,"date":1393426224,"author":"Anonymous"},"author":"Anonymous","imgurl":"1393424091218","tn_w":183,"tn_h":250,"sub":"Headphone General","teaser":"&gt;Show your headphones &gt;Be happy"},"40534295":{"date":1393424149,"r":18,"i":0,"lr":{"id":40534699,"date":1393426222,"author":"Anonymous"},"author":"Anonymous","imgurl":"1393424149206","tn_w":249,"tn_h":174,"sub":"","teaser":"Are MacBooks actually good specs wise?

The airport extreme is capable of 802.11a\/b\/g\/n, whilst the express&#039; are capable of 802.11a\/b\/g\/Draft N (both according to wikipedia). Our internet is very slow (6mbps) if you are anywhere near the two express&#039; that extend the network, whilst fast if you are near the extreme (30mbps). Today I tried turning off both of the extenders (express&#039;) and my speed went from 6mbps to 21mbps. So I figure that the extenders are bottlenecking the &#039;n&#039; speeds I should be getting from the main router. Turning the extenders off and ditching them would be a viable solution if anything apart from our family&#039;s laptops could pick up the connections. All of our phones and tablets can&#039;t pick up the signal from the main router which was the reason we bought the express&#039; to extend the network in the first place. I&#039;ve read the wiki but it&#039;s not really directly what I&#039;m looking for. I assume I need to buy two new extenders, or if it helps, a new router to replace the apple extreme that will just cover the whole house. Are any of the \/g\/ recommended routers capable of what I&#039;m looking to do? Or should I just buy the updated airport express (it is capable of 802.11a\/b\/g\/n\/ac). This would be easier as it all works together in the Airport Utility, and because I&#039;m not always home my parents aren&#039;t going to know how to use complex routers in the event I&#039;m not around the house).

However, you asked us to do more. You asked us to bring you even closer to the metal and to do so on an unparalleled assortment of hardware. You also asked us for better tools so that you can squeeze every last drop of performance out of your PC, tablet, phone and console. <a href="http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style="cursor:help;display:inline !important;">http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828184</a> Approaching Zero Driver Overhead in OpenGL - Driver overhead has been a frustrating reality for game developers for the entire life of the PC game industry. On desktop systems, driver overhead can decrease frame rate, while on mobile devices driver overhead is more insidious--robbing both battery life and frame rate. In this unprecedented sponsored session, Graham Sellers (AMD), Tim Foley (Intel), Cass Everitt (NVIDIA) and John McDonald (NVIDIA) will present high-level concepts available in today's OpenGL implementations that radically reduce driver overhead--by up to 10x or more. <a href="http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" style="cursor:help;display:inline !important;">http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828316</a> IT'S OVER, AMD IS FINISHED</div></div><div id="thread-40534286" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40534286"><img alt="" id="thumb-40534286" class="thumb" width="109.8" height="150" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393424091218s.jpg" data-id="40534286"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40534286" class="meta">R: <b>35</b> / I: <b>14</b></div><div class="teaser"><b>Headphone General</b>: &gt;Show your headphones &gt;Be happy</div></div><div id="thread-40534295" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40534295"><img alt="" id="thumb-40534295" class="thumb" width="150" height="104.81927710843374" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393424149206s.jpg" data-id="40534295"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40534295" class="meta">R: <b>18</b></div><div class="teaser">Are MacBooks actually good specs wise?

I predict that tablets and phones will merge at 6,4" point, which is comfy enough to read A4 pdf's for long time yet still pocketable (fashion is already changing to direction of larger phones). After that tablets become obsolete. This is happening now and tablets are obsolete by 2016. You know the one thing you want when buying a new phone is bigger and sharper screen.

I've searched around and found a bunch of applications that do this, but I might as well ask here if is there any preference or a lightweight windows program for that goal?</div></div><div id="thread-40534009" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40534009"><img alt="" id="thumb-40534009" class="thumb" width="150" height="150" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393422317461s.jpg" data-id="40534009"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40534009" class="meta">R: <b>3</b></div><div class="teaser">hey /g/ I know you are not a personal tech support. But I have been all over google and cant find anything that actually helps me with this problem. So I have 2 hard drives, my original one which came with windows vista, and my new one which I installed windows 7 onto. Well yesterday my computer was throwing a hissy fit so I went to restart it. It got stuck saying shutting down so I used the button to force it to shut down. When I turned it back on I got an error saying it was failing to boot and I needed to try to boot from something else, which is weird because it should usually give me the option to boot from eitehr Vista or Windows 7, it was acting like both installs of my OS were just deleted, so to get it to boot I re installed windows 7 onto my first hard drives data partition. Now I need to get my computer to boot from my second hard drive, I don't want to re format and almost nothing on this new install is working because all my old files give me weird "access violation" errors. I am kind of computer illiterate but know most of the basics so any ideas?</div></div><div id="thread-40532738" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40532738"><img alt="" id="thumb-40532738" class="thumb" width="150" height="125.39999999999999" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393413300136s.jpg" data-id="40532738"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40532738" class="meta">R: <b>27</b> / I: <b>3</b></div><div class="teaser">Why is it so perfect?</div></div><div id="thread-40532947" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40532947"><img alt="" id="thumb-40532947" class="thumb" width="150" height="150" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393414907832s.jpg" data-id="40532947"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40532947" class="meta">R: <b>7</b> / I: <b>1</b></div><div class="teaser">How do you describe free software?</div></div><div id="thread-40523072" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40523072"><img alt="" id="thumb-40523072" class="thumb" width="150" height="109.8" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393369208537s.jpg" data-id="40523072"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40523072" class="meta">R: <b>178</b> / I: <b>46</b></div><div class="teaser">No guts thread?

The airport extreme is capable of 802.11a/b/g/n, whilst the express' are capable of 802.11a/b/g/Draft N (both according to wikipedia). Our internet is very slow (6mbps) if you are anywhere near the two express' that extend the network, whilst fast if you are near the extreme (30mbps). Today I tried turning off both of the extenders (express') and my speed went from 6mbps to 21mbps. So I figure that the extenders are bottlenecking the 'n' speeds I should be getting from the main router. Turning the extenders off and ditching them would be a viable solution if anything apart from our family's laptops could pick up the connections. All of our phones and tablets can't pick up the signal from the main router which was the reason we bought the express' to extend the network in the first place. I've read the wiki but it's not really directly what I'm looking for. I assume I need to buy two new extenders, or if it helps, a new router to replace the apple extreme that will just cover the whole house. Are any of the /g/ recommended routers capable of what I'm looking to do? Or should I just buy the updated airport express (it is capable of 802.11a/b/g/n/ac). This would be easier as it all works together in the Airport Utility, and because I'm not always home my parents aren't going to know how to use complex routers in the event I'm not around the house). I need the total range to be about 30 metres in all directions from the router (it's in the middle of our house). Has anyone had the same problem and know of any solutions? I'm willing to spend as much as necessary in order to repair this problem.</div></div><div id="thread-40530512" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40530512"><img alt="" id="thumb-40530512" class="thumb" width="150" height="112.5" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393399009959s.jpg" data-id="40530512"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40530512" class="meta">R: <b>80</b> / I: <b>9</b></div><div class="teaser">What torrent software does /g/ use?</div></div><div id="thread-40529993" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4chan.org/g/res/40529993"><img alt="" id="thumb-40529993" class="thumb" width="150" height="70.2" src="./ g  - Technology - Catalog_files/1393396239427s.jpg" data-id="40529993"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mages" id="meta-40529993" class="meta">R: <b>13</b> / I: <b>2</b></div><div class="teaser">Moved the computer and the adapter bent and the four circled pins are now stuck in one of my video card's video outputs.

So it's either the Samsung Evo 840 Basic 120gb or a Crucial M500 240gb. As I understand the Crucial is definitively the slower of the two - but since I'd use the SSD primarily for gaming and raw editing (and usually the raws aren't bigger than 20-40mb) I figure that I probably won't notice a difference, or will I?

I was wondering if any of you could suggest a solution to the following problem: - Need a case for a new 17.3" laptop - Hard shell preferred - Preferably have compartments for keyboard, mouse, charger, cable lock - Key lock or combination lock preferred, but not necessary I don't need any other compartments. No tablets or pens or cell phones. I've been searching for a few days and haven't found much of any value. There're a few companies that offer cases with custom foam / plastic inserts that I'm thinking I might need to look at; but thought I'd check if you all knew of any obscure manufacturers.
