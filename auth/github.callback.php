1. Redirect users to request GitHub access

https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize

Parameters
Name	Type	Description
client_id	string	Required. The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
redirect_uri	string	The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about redirect urls.
scope	string	A comma separated list of scopes. If not provided, scope defaults to an empty list of scopes for users that don’t have a valid token for the app. For users who do already have a valid token for the app, the user won’t be shown the OAuth authorization page with the list of scopes. Instead, this step of the flow will automatically complete with the same scopes that were used last time the user completed the flow.
state	string	An unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

2. GitHub redirects back to your site

If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a code parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a state parameter. If the states don’t match, the request has been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.

Exchange this for an access token:

POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
Parameters

Name	Type	Description
client_id	string	Required. The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
client_secret	string	Required. The client secret you received from GitHub when you registered.
code	string	Required. The code you received as a response to Step 1.
redirect_uri	string	The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about redirect urls.
Response

By default, the response will take the following form:

access_token=e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a&scope=user%2Cgist&token_type=bearer
You can also receive the content in different formats depending on the Accept header:

Accept: application/json
{"access_token":"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a", "scope":"repo,gist", "token_type":"bearer"}

Accept: application/xml
<OAuth>
  <token_type>bearer</token_type>
  <scope>repo,gist</scope>
  <access_token>e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a</access_token>
</OAuth>
Requested scopes vs. granted scopes
The scope attribute lists scopes attached to the token that were granted by the user. Normally, these scopes will be identical to what you requested. However, users will soon be able to edit their scopes, effectively granting your application less access than you originally requested. Also, users will also be able to edit token scopes after the OAuth flow completed. You should be aware of this possibility and adjust your application’s behavior accordingly.

It is important to handle error cases where a user chooses to grant you less access than you originally requested. For example, applications can warn or otherwise communicate with their users that they will see reduced functionality or be unable to perform some actions.

Also, applications can always send users back through the flow again to get additional permission, but don’t forget that users can always say no.

Check out the Basics of Authentication guide which provides tips on handling modifiable token scopes.

Normalized scopes
When requesting multiple scopes, the token will be saved with a normalized list of scopes, discarding those that are implicitly included by another requested scope. For example, requesting user,gist,user:email will result in a token with user and gist scopes only since the access granted with user:email scope is included in the user scope.

3. Use the access token to access the API

The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.

GET https://api.github.com/user?access_token=...
You can pass the token in the query params like shown above, but a cleaner approach is to include it in the Authorization header

Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN
For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:

curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
Non-Web Application Flow

Use Basic Authentication to create an OAuth2 token using the interface below. With this technique, a username and password need not be stored permanently, and the user can revoke access at any time. (Make sure to understand how to work with two-factor authentication if you or your users have two-factor authentication enabled.)

Redirect URLs

The redirect_uri parameter is optional. If left out, GitHub will redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth Application settings. If provided, the redirect URL’s host and port must exactly match the callback URL. The redirect URL’s path must reference a subdirectory of the callback URL.

CALLBACK: http://example.com/path

GOOD: http://example.com/path
GOOD: http://example.com/path/subdir/other
BAD:  http://example.com/bar
BAD:  http://example.com/
BAD:  http://example.com:8080/path
BAD:  http://oauth.example.com:8080/path
BAD:  http://example.org
Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has.

For the web flow, requested scopes will be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

Check headers to see what OAuth scopes you have, and what the API action accepts.

$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie -I
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user
X-OAuth-Scopes lists the scopes your token has authorized. X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes lists the scopes that the action checks for.

Name	Description
(no scope)	Grants read-only access to public information (includes public user profile info, public repository info, and gists)
user	Grants read/write access to profile info only. Note that this scope includes user:email and user:follow.
user:email	Grants read access to a user’s email addresses.
user:follow	Grants access to follow or unfollow other users.
public_repo	Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses, and deployment statuses for public repositories and organizations.
repo	Grants read/write access to code, commit statuses, and deployment statuses for public and private repositories and organizations.
repo_deployment	Grants access to deployment statuses for public and private repositories. This scope is only necessary to grant other users or services access to deployment statuses, without granting access to the code.
repo:status	Grants read/write access to public and private repository commit statuses. This scope is only necessary to grant other users or services access to private repository commit statuses without granting access to the code.
delete_repo	Grants access to delete adminable repositories.
notifications	Grants read access to a user’s notifications. repo also provides this access.
gist	Grants write access to gists.
read:repo_hook	Grants read and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories.
write:repo_hook	Grants read, write, and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories.
admin:repo_hook	Grants read, write, ping, and delete access to hooks in public or private repositories.
read:org	Read-only access to organization, teams, and membership.
write:org	Publicize and unpublicize organization membership.
admin:org	Fully manage organization, teams, and memberships.
read:public_key	List and view details for public keys.
write:public_key	Create, list, and view details for public keys.
admin:public_key	Fully manage public keys.
NOTE: Your application can request the scopes in the initial redirection. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with a comma:

https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=...&
  scope=user,public_repo
Common errors for the authorization request

There are a few things that can go wrong in the process of obtaining an OAuth token for a user. In the initial authorization request phase, these are some errors you might see:

Application Suspended

If the OAuth application you set up has been suspended (due to reported abuse, spam, or a mis-use of the API), GitHub will redirect to the registered callback URL with the following parameters summerizing the error:

http://your-application.com/callback?error=application_suspended
  &error_description=Your+application+has+been+suspended.+Contact+support@github.com.
  &error_uri=https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/%23application-suspended
  &state=xyz
Please contact support to solve issues with suspended applications.

Redirect URI mismatch

If you provide a redirect_uri that doesn’t match what you’ve registered with your application, GitHub will redirect to the registered callback URL with the following parameters summerizing the error:

http://your-application.com/callback?error=redirect_uri_mismatch
  &error_description=The+redirect_uri+MUST+match+the+registered+callback+URL+for+this+application.
  &error_uri=https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/%23redirect-uri-mismatch
  &state=xyz
To correct this error, either provide a redirect_uri that matches what you registered or leave out this parameter to use the default one registered with your application.

Access denied

If the user rejects access to your application, GItHub will redirect to the registered callback URL with the following parameters summerizing the error:

http://your-application.com/callback?error=access_denied
  &error_description=The+user+has+denied+your+application+access.
  &error_uri=https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/%23access-denied
  &state=xyz
There’s nothing you can do here as users are free to choose not to use your application. More often than not, users will just close the window or press back in their browser, so it is likely that you’ll never see this error.

Common errors for the access token request

In the second phase of exchanging a code for an access token, there are an additional set of errors that can occur. The format of these responses is determined by the accept header you pass. The following examples only show JSON responses.
