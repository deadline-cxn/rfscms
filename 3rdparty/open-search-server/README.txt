OpenSearchServer was developed in such a way that you can do all of
these things as simply as possible. You will have full access to all
of the components of our search engine. This is the most important
feature that we wanted to offer you. It means that, instead of having
to accept fixed parameters and options set by us, you will have total
freedom to customize any parameters to perfectly match the needs of
your application. You will never face a black box.
