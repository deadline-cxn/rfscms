OSS API Connector for PHP

This API connector is intended to be used with PHP5 with any version >= 5.0.1
For some part it would have been easier to use native functions of latests PHP5.

You can find more about the OSS API on the OSS WiKi

http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/opensearchserve

I) Error handling

 We know that some of you hate exceptions and some others won't work without
 them so to consiliate both party we provide two methods:

 - Returning a false and trigger the error as E_USER_ERROR or E_USER_WARNING
 - Throw exceptions

 If you want to use exception, just include le file OSS_Exceptions.class.php.
 To know the method to use to handle errors the API connector look for the
 existence of the class OSSException. If found exceptions are thrown. On the
 other hand if not, errors are triggered and false is returned.

II) How to use the provided samples

 You need an HTTP Server that can parse PHP5. There's many of them around the
 web you can use for free. We won't provide a complete guide to install,
 configure and use them.
 
 Windows)
 
  If you have administrator rights:
   
   We recommand the WAMP server that provide you with all you need to run theses
   samples. When installed check if these PHP module is activated:
   
    - curl
   
   Once started copy the directories contrib and lib in your server root folder.
   On WAMP if you installed it with default options you'll find it under this
   path:
   
   C:\Program Files\wamp\www
   
   Then launch your favorite browser and browse http://localhost/contrib/
   
  If you don't have administrator rights:
  
   We provide a package with minimal PHP5 support plus a web server (nginx) in a
   single archive file.
   
   Grab it here: <<PROVIDE URL TO D/L>>
   
   Note: The API and samples are already included in this archive so you only
   need to unzip, launch start.bat and start your browser pointing
   
   http://localhost/
   
 Linux)
 
  Get a look at one of those:
  
   - Apache2 + mod_php5
   - lighttpd + php5 in fast_cgi
   - nginx + php5 in fast_cgi
  
  There's so many tutorial on the net to install them that we won't bother you
  explaining further.
